# Svelte Router SPA Examples

Examples from the repository: https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle/svelte-spa-router

Simple plug-into the vite template (`npm init @vitejs/app`).

## Findings

From previous exploration, I was getting really confused to why it was working as a normal
non-hash-based router - like React router.

After plugging the examples into the Vite template, it appears to work as expected.
