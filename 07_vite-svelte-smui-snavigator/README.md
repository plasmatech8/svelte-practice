# Svelte + Vite

I cannot get themes to work with SCSS. Need to try again.

The default theme version + plain CSS works, but I want the typography to be automatically applied
globally.

* Try vite prepressors
* Try using `@smui/button/styled` instead of regular

See:
* Svelte REPL for Svelte Navigator (actually a really nice router)

* Svelte Material UI (ok)
