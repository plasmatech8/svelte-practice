## Notes

Routing options:
* React Routing
  * Most similar to React Router
  * Needs a server
* React SPA Router
  * No server / SPA only
  * Bad for Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) - not as easily crawlable
  * Uses hash ID routing (website.com#this/is/your/route) - >:(
* Sapper
  * Most official router - but will never get a production version
  * Can use with server (npm run build)
  * Can use without server (npm run export)
  * Lots of features
* Routify
  * Lots of features
  * Can use without a server

Sapper and Routify are the only good options for most scenarios IMO.
